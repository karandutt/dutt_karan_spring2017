Create a folder structure to read all these json files and store them into these separate folders. You are expected to create a hierarchy of folder structure.\n",
    "- PART 2 : Read only the json files which contain the key called “restaurants” Each (or most of the json files) contain a key called “open” which contains the details of the operation (timings) of the restaurants. For each json file, read the timings of the restaurants. Data of the operation timings of the restaurants is present for each day of the week. I want you to extract each of this data and write it in an excel sheet."
