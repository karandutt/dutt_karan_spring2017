# Final

As part of the final assignment, we were to perform 5 analysis on a readily available dataset.
For my analysis, I decided to look into and analyze temperatures across the global, especially on land.
Today, being Earth day, I try to find out how global warming is slowly but surely heating our planet.

## Analysis 1: Temperature changes in each season

To begin with some concrete example, I decided to look at the temperature fluctuations and changes in every season. Across the globe, there are four seasons - Summers, Autumns, Spring and Winters. The average temperature in each of the four seasons across the globe has shown an upward trend, especially after the late 1900's. Prior to that, the fluctuations seen in the graph below could be as a result of instruments not being as advanced as it is today.
