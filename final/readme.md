# Final

As part of the final assignment, we were to perform 5 analysis on a readily available dataset.
For my analysis, I decided to look into and analyze temperatures across the global, especially on land.
Today, being Earth day, I try to find out how global warming is slowly but surely heating our planet.

## Analysis 1: Temperature changes in each season

To begin with some concrete example, I decided to look at the temperature fluctuations and changes in every season. Across the globe, there are four seasons - Summers, Autumns, Spring and Winters. The average temperature in each of the four seasons across the globe has shown an upward trend, especially after the late 1900's. Prior to that, the fluctuations seen in the graph below could be as a result of instruments not being as advanced as it is today.

### Average land temperature by Country

While the graph showed an upward trend in temperature increase throughout the globe, let us look into the average land temperatures in all the countries around the globe and try to analyze whether countries in the cold regions and hot regions have high land temperatures. This would allow us to understand, whether Greenland being a cold country is getting warmer or not and how hot are the countries in the desert region showing up.

## Analysis 2: Countries with highest temperature differences.

By analyzing the countries with the highest temperature differences, which is the difference between the maximum temperature value and the minimum temperature value we can find out how extreme the climate is getting in some countries. If the temperature difference in the colder countries is getting increasingly larger it is a sign that global warming is affecting the region. For example, a cold country like Greenland or Russia should have less temperature difference since they are near the poles. This can be seen in the graph below

## Analysis 3: Temperatures in India.

By performing analyses on India, I wanted to find out how much temperature increase there has been in the last few years. I often starting noticing that temperatures in Mumbai are getting hotter by the day and even during "winter", temperatures hover above 85 degrees F. From the graph below, we can see that the Average minimum and maximum temperatures have risen by 2-4 degree C. The temperature uncertainty too is constant which means it is inevitable that warm air will flow and fluctuation in temperatures could be a rare thing. This is a sign of global warming.

From the graph below, we can also see that on an average temperatures in India hovers around 26-28 days for a period of 70-80 days for most part of the year with cooler temperatures only for a period of two weeks. This can be seen in the histogram below

## Analysis 4: Global Temperature Trends and Mean, Min and Max temperatures for random Cities

Now that we have analyzed for a country like India, let us see what is the situation of cities around the world where pollution is at an all time high and also analyze the global temperature trends. For this, we will first look at global temperature trends since 1750. In the graph below, we can see that before the 1900s the temperature fluctuations were sporadic and this could be possibly due to the instruments used.

Global temperatures are showing a clear upward trend after the 1900s.
Talking about cities, let us analyze the temperature increase in cities.
We analyze the yearly mean temperature increase, yearly max temperature increase and the yearly min temperature increase for the cities.
