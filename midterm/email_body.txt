Re: TCW Galileo Aggressive Growth Equities Fund

I spoke with Bob Hanisee from TCW and he confirmed that if you put any more 
monies into the fund before December 20th you would be subject to all of the 
capital gains for the year.  He recommended that we hold off until such time.

I asked him to find out about the Small Cap Growth Fund and Select Equities 
Fund as well, so that we would be well informed about any similar 
circumstances.

Royal Carson of Carson Private Capital wanted to set-up a time to meet with 
you to give you an update on the two funds - Fund IV & Europe Fund.  I am 
going to go ahead and meet with him next week in Dallas since I will be there 
attending the Family Wealth Roundtable (11/16-17).  I will fill you in on our 
meeting.

Since you left for India, and in case I forget to tell you, I asked to have a 
new banking rep to replace Howard Williams for LPL Prop & Interiors.  Since I 
was doing this, both Sally and Sherrie felt it best to have all of our 
business with one person rather than dealing with two.  So, we will now be 
dealing with Margaret Barradas who is Howard's superior.  Where James Shelton 
was a hard act to follow, Howard should be a piece of cake.  Anyone merely 
pleasant and respectful would be an upgrade to Howard and hopefully our new 
rep will fill the bill.   Love, L.

Dear Family and Friends,
Ken and I just cut short our Italy trip with friends to return to Houston
for the birth of our 6th grandchild (which is the final one for this round
of four pregnancies).  We were happy to return home and I am a very thankful
and thrilled grandmother (aka Momie, Mamamia, Mamia, Mia).  This was the
first live birth that I have personally witnessed since my last baby, Beau,
and it was VERY exhilarating and VERY emotional, as evidenced by the
attached photos.  I hope you will enjoy seeing my new grandson "Pate David
Herrold" (Pate was Courtney's maiden name) who was born on June 8, 2000 at
7:19 p.m.  Pate was 7 lbs, 10 ozs, 20 inches long with a lot of dark curly
hair.  I think he looks exactly like David at birth, but time will tell.
These photos were taken in the delivery room within the first 15-20 minutes
of his birth prior to being cleaned up and returned to the nursery.  He
looks pretty darn good for just having arrived into this world with such
great force.  So far, he is a VERY calm and good infant just like his Daddy
was.  Enjoy!  Big kiss and lots of love, LPL

Dear Family,
As you can see below, at 90 years young, Daddy (aka Pop-Pop) has his own

hear from you from time-to-time.  I'm sure he would especially like to be
updated with recent photos of you and your families...me too!  If you have
any other family members e-mail addresses, let me know.  Big Kiss.  Love,
Linda/Mom/Aunt Linda
